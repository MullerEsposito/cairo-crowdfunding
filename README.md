# Cairo Crowdfunding

Cairo Crowdfunding is a decentralized crowdfunding platform built using Cairo for smart contracts. It allows users to create crowdfunding campaigns, contribute to existing campaigns, and manage fund allocations through a voting system. The project aims to ensure transparency and fairness in fund distribution by giving contributors the power to approve or reject fund usage requests.

## Features

- **Create a new crowdfunding**: Users can start new crowdfunding campaigns.
- **Get all crowdfunding**: Retrieve a list of all active crowdfunding campaigns.
- **Make a contribution**: Users can contribute to a crowdfunding campaign, ensuring a minimum contribution amount.
- **Request fund usage**: The crowdfunding manager can create requests to utilize the funds raised.
- **Vote on requests**: Contributors can vote to approve or disapprove a manager's request.
- **Finalize fund release**: Once a request gains majority approval, the manager can release the funds to the designated supplier.
